    <h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

 <p>Dear users,</p>

  <p>what you have downloaded is a small web application written in PHP, which uses
database (typically MySQL) and class JpGraph or Open flash chart for generating
graphs. It can nicely show ip some useful statistics from your ethernet
thermometer/hydrometer.</p>

  <p>How it works? Your TME with access to Internet (or local network) sends actual
measurement to PHP script. Script writes this measurement into database for
future data generating.</p>

  <p>For new versions and future informations, please check out
<a href="http://multi.tricker.cz">my blog</a> or <a href="http://www.papouch.com">Papouch website</a> and if
you need some help or just want to say "thanks", you can give contact me <a href="mailto:multi@tricker.cz">multi@tricker.cz</a></p>

    <h2><a name="instalation">Installation</a></h2>

  <p>Now, let´s make it work:</p>

  <h3>1) First, we need to setup TME/TH2E unit.</h3>

<h4>Setting up TH2E</h4>

<a href="nastaveni-th2e.gif" target="_blank"><img src="nastaveni-th2e.gif" alt="Nastaveni" title="Nastaveni" border="0" height="120" width="160"></a>

<p>Connect onto TH2E website and choose settings. There is need to have correctly filled up parameters on tab "Network",
most importantly IP address, mask, gateway and DNS. Next, choose tab "Sending" and fill address of web server, port (80),
scripts folder on server, period for sending GET (1 - once per minute) and fill script name (index.php). </p>

<p>For example, if address of your app will be <i>http://moje.mereni.cz/aplikace/</i>, then fill:<br>
<b>Web server address:</b> moje.mereni.cz<br>
<b>Port:</b> 80 (standard port)<br>
<b>Script folder on server:</b> aplikace/<br>
<b>GET sending period:</b> 1<br>
<b>Script name (GET):</b> index.php</p>

<h4>Setting up newer TME</h4>

<a href="nastaveni-tme.gif" target="_blank"><img src="nastaveni-tme.gif" alt="Nastaveni" title="Nastaveni" border="0" height="120" width="160"></a>

<p>Connect onto TME website and choose settings. There is need to have correctly filled up parameters on tab "Network",
most importantly IP address, mask and gateway. Next, choose tab "Sending" and fill IP address of web server,
web server name (www.someting.com), port (80), scripts folder on server, period for sending (60 sec - once per minute) and check activation of HTTP GET sending and
fill Script name (index.php). </p>

<p>For example, if address of your app will be <i>http://moje.mereni.cz/aplikace/</i>, then fill:<br>
<b>Web server address:</b> <i>you will find out this from your web hosting provider or with ping utility</i><br>
<b>Web server name:</b> moje.mereni.cz<br>
<b>Port:</b> 80 (standard port)<br>
<b>Script folder on server:</b> aplikace/<br>
<b>Script name:</b> index.php</p>

<h4>Setting up oldest TME (1.6, 1.7)</h4>

<a href="nastaveni-tme-stare.gif" target="_blank"><img src="nastaveni-tme-stare.gif" alt="Nastaveni" title="Nastaveni" border="0" height="120" width="160"></a>

  <p>Connect into TME via configuration utility from Papouch. (You can find configuration utility here:
<a href="http://www.papouch.com/cz/shop/product/tme-ethernetovy-teplomer/">http://www.papouch.com/cz/shop/product/tme-ethernetovy-teplomer/</a>).
On item HTTP GET check "Send temperature on HTTP server",
into URL path write full path where web application will be located and file
index.php, ie.: http://www.lojzuvweb.cz/tme/index.php<br>
  Into IP address write IP address of web server, where site is located.
This address can be very easily filled up when you click onto "at" symbol.</p>

  <p>Next, set up sending period 60 sec (once every minute, application counts with
this settings) and into GUID fill some random word without diacritics and spaces -
you will need this on further step.</p>

  <p>Finally save settings.</p>

  <h3>2) Configuring TMEP</h3>

  <p>In folder "app" are all needed files and there is also file
"config.php", where you must fill out values for connection to database
(database server, username, password, database name). You should get these
values from your webhosting provider. If you are using oldest TME, then there is VERY IMPORTANT to set GUID
and instead "teplota" fill your own string from first step.</p>

  <h3>3) Setting up database</h3>

  <p>There is need to create proprietary tables in database, where scripts save
values from TME. Which program/web application for table create you use, is on
you. SQL code for execution is located in file "mysql-db-full.sql".</p>

  <h3>4) Uploading application on web</h3>

  <p>Now, upload whole web application (everything what folder "app"
contains) on it´s place on internet. Path to "index.php" must be the exact path,
that you set up in first step into TME/TH2E via configuration utility.</p>

  <p>Now, everything should be set up and saved, how it supposed to be.
  Application now receive measured values and generate some text statistics and
graphs.</p>

  <p>Thank you for attention and have fun</p>

    <h2><a name="update">Update to v8</a></h2>

 <p>How to UPDATE on TMEP v5/6.5/7/8:</p>

  <p>It´s pretty simple. You need to:</p>

  <p>1) Update database scheme, if you have v5 or older. To do that, just execute
"mysql-db-update-v5.sql" on your database. It will do the necessary changes.
You can use some simple database administration for that task.
I recommend Adminer - http://www.adminer.org.</p>

  <p>2) Overwrite old files with the new ones except "config.php",
located in "app" folder in archive you downloaded along with this update instructions.
If you did any changes in old files, you will need to do them again (in CSS styles etc.).
Rename file "nastaveni.php" to "config.php".
Add line with "$vlhkomer" in "config.php" to determine if you want to show measured
humidity. No need for this if you do not measure it.</p>

  <p>3) Delete "cache" folder in application. There is no need for it now.</p>

  <p>4) There is need to compute a lot of information about measurements from earlier days except actual day.
  To do so, open script "scripts/dopocitat.php" in your browser from application website. Do it as long as needed -
  script will write what day has just been finished. This could take some time on slow servers with huge
  database of measurements. These calculations are also realized when page of TMEP app is opened.
  For me, it took about 3 minutes to compute more than 3 years of measurements, so it should be very quick.</p>
